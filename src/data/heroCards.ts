/**
 * heroCards — data source for the HeroWebGL floating-cards scene (task 11.3).
 *
 * Each entry describes one image card rendered as a textured plane in the 3D
 * cloud. The scene reads this array and repeats it to fill the active card
 * count (determined by viewport category). To swap or add images, edit this
 * file only — the scene derives everything else from it.
 *
 * `orientation` drives the aspect ratio of the card's plane geometry:
 *   portrait  → 3:4 (taller than wide)
 *   landscape → 4:3 (wider than tall)
 *   square    → 1:1
 *
 * _Requirements: 19.5_
