/**
 * Legal document content for the `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/cookies` routes.
 *
 * `LegalPage` is a single param-driven template (design "12. /privacy · /terms
 * · /cookies"); this module is its typed content source. Each `LegalDoc` holds
 * a title, a human-readable last-updated label, and an ordered list of
 * `LegalSection`s. Section `id`s are stable slugs used both as the heading
 * anchor (`<h2 id>`) and as the auto-generated table-of-contents target, so
 * they MUST be unique within a document.
 *
 * Copy here is realistic placeholder long-form content — it conveys the shape
 * and tone of each policy without being legal advice; replace with
 * counsel-reviewed text before launch.
 *
 * Requirements: 17.1 (long-form content per route with TOC + last-updated).
