/**
 * Register GSAP timelines / ScrollTriggers scoped to a single element with
 * automatic cleanup.
 *
 * The hook creates a ref for the caller to attach to a DOM element, then in a
 * `useLayoutEffect` runs the provided `setup` inside a `gsap.context(...)`
 * scoped to that element. Every animation, timeline, and ScrollTrigger created
 * inside `setup` is tracked by the context, so the returned cleanup
 * (`ctx.revert()`) reverts and kills all of them on unmount or when `deps`
 * change. This satisfies the "cleanup is mandatory" rule and Requirement 20.4
 * (a page's ScrollTriggers/timelines are killed when it unmounts).
 *
 * `setup` receives `{ el, gsap, ScrollTrigger, reducedMotion }`. The
 * `reducedMotion` flag (sourced from {@link useReducedMotion}) lets callers
 * branch: when `true` they should skip scrubbed motion and apply the animation's
 * end state instantly (content visible, no movement) per the reduced-motion
 * fallback rules. `reducedMotion` is included in the effect dependencies so the
 * context re-runs if the preference changes at runtime.
 *
 * `ScrollTrigger` is registered with GSAP once on module load so callers never
 * have to register it themselves.
 *
 * _Requirements: 20.4_
