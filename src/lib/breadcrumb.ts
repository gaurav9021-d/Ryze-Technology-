/**
 * Build a breadcrumb trail for `pathname`.

 * @param labelMap - Maps a path segment OR a cumulative path to its
 *   human-readable label. For each segment the cumulative path is looked up
 *   first (more specific), then the bare segment; if neither is present the
 *   label falls back to a humanized (Title Case) form of the segment
 *   (Requirement 3.4). The root key `'/'` overrides the Home label.
 * @returns The trail, always starting with Home. Segments appear in path order
 *   (Requirement 3.2) and only the last item omits `path` (Requirement 3.3).
 *   The total item count equals the number of meaningful segments + 1 (Home).
 *
 * Edge case — root path (`'/'` or `''`): there are no meaningful segments, so
 * the trail is just `[Home]`. Because Home is then the last (and only) item, it
 * represents the current page and therefore omits its `path`. This keeps the
 * "only the last item omits path" invariant true for every input.
