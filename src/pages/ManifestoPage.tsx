/**
 * ManifestoPage — `/manifesto` studio manifesto (task 14.13).
 *
 * Composition (design "7. /manifesto"):
 *   Hero (oversized type) → Core beliefs (a pinned sequential reveal where
 *   motion is allowed, each belief reading like a held statement) → "What we
 *   stand against" inverted/high-contrast band → "The Ryze promise" → CTA.
 *
 * This is the most type-forward, motion-restrained-but-bold page: oversized
 * display headings carry the weight, with copy in an "Engineered Permanence"
 * voice — software built to work forever (Requirement 12.1).
 *
 * Motion (Requirements 12.2, 37.2): WHERE motion is allowed, the core beliefs
 * are presented as a sequential reveal (each belief rises in turn, staggered).
 * The beliefs are authored as real, ordered DOM content (an `<ol>`), so they
 * are always present and readable. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`,
 * `AnimationWrapper` renders its children immediately in their final, fully
 * visible end state with NO IntersectionObserver gating, pinning, or scroll
 * dependency — so every belief is visible and the page is fully usable as a
 * flowing static document.
 *
 * _Requirements: 12.1, 12.2, 37.2_
